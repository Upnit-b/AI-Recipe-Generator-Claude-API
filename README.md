## ✨ What is Recipe Generator?

**Recipe Generator** is a modern, AI-powered web app that helps you decide *what to cook* using the ingredients you already have at home.

Instead of searching endless recipes, you simply:
1. Add your ingredients
2. Click **“Get a recipe”**
3. Instantly receive a **beautifully formatted recipe in Markdown**

The AI may suggest a few extra ingredients — but always keeps it realistic and minimal.

**Recipe Generator** was built to demonstrate:
- Secure **server-side AI integration**
- Clean **frontend–backend separation**
- Real-world **deployment readiness**
- Thoughtful **UX for non-technical users**
